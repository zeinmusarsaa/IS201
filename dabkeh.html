                        <p>According to an article posted by Johanna Sellman, "Dabke (also spelled as Dabka/[or Dabkeh]) is an Arabic folk dance which originated in the mountains of the Levantine region. This region in the Middle East includes the countries of Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. Dabke is derived from the Levantine Arabic word dabaka (Arabic: دبكة) meaning “stamping of the feet” or “to make a noise”. "</p>
                        <p>As a Dabkeh dancer myself, for over 10 years, I can say that Dabkeh is more than the stomping if the feet or a mere dance during celebrations or sad events. Dabkeh is more than that to everyone who dances it. For Palestinians, dancing Dabkeh means the perserving of cultural aspects of our country that is continiously under war. </p>
                        <h1>The Experience of Dancing</h1>
                        <p>Once you have done bootcamps, worked out for years, and learned the moved for over 10 songs, you are ready to perform, and let me tell you, performing is the most rewarding, selfless act you can do as a Palestinian because you are at the highest risk you can be to die on stage</p>
                        <p>For example, there was one time we had planned to perform in Boureen, a village near Nablus. The day of our performance there were 3 martyrs, and we had asked the people in the village to cancel out of respect for the dead, but they wanted us to perform for those who have risked their lives. Because it is a cultural dance, and through it you express your resistance, we thought it would be a good way to pay the villagers back.</p>
                        <p>Right across from Boureen there is a settlement, and Israeli soldiers around that settlement with rifles in order to prevent any Palestinians from entering that area. We began our performance when two Israeli soldiers came down and asked one of the villagers what is going on. The villager told them it was a wedding so that we could continue dancing, without being hurt.
                            Surprisingly, they sat there and watched. We felt as though there was a looming threat, any dance that we did about Palestine could result in open fire against us, we did not have any way to defend ourselves. We continued to dance.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is only one example of many from my own experience. My father danced during the war, my coach danced during the war, we had soldiers come to our dance studio and throw tear gas in order to stop us from dancing.</p>
                        <p>But we still danced.</p>
